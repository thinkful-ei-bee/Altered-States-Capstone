## Summary
This app was inspired by the abundance of free artificial intelligence. One of the most exciting consequences of this is to bring humans and technology closer together. 

Along with being a journalling app, miMood is an emotion tracker. Users can write entries as well as upload selfies, which are sent to 
two seperate AIs and scanned for written tone and facial expression. 
The data from these AIs are represented using radar charts. Users can view data from their past entries in seperate line charts for each emotion. 

Much like a traditional journal, the writer can return to their old entries and reflect on their experiences. With miMood, an additional element of emotion is archived for a more personal narrative.
